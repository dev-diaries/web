Using the & after a declaration you can set a css rule to apply given that the 
selector that has the & after actually applies when it is the parent of the element it is nested under. ðŸ¤”?
So basically, you read the rule inside out. So in the first example you read if 
.parent-in-this-case & is the parent of .some-class, then apply this rule.

Why would you do this? One example is to affect a style for only ie-9 for 
example and if you apply a class when a browser is ie-9 or below you can set 
specific styles within a block that only apply when ie-9 is the parent class on the html tag.

The & in css offers a lot of power, but can also be a bit confusing so be mindful
of your usage!
