One really nice feature of Linux is its ability to maintain a history of the 
commands you typed in. Its like a little journal of your linux journey and you 
can easily access and browse with some handy commands. There are some commands 
that youâ€™ll run often and being able to reference those can be extremely useful. 
We've written about leveraging your history before in our article [terminal history 
auto suggestions as you type with oh my zsh](/blog/terminal-history-auto-suggestions-as-you-type/)
so we're big fans of being efficient and reusing commands in our terminal.
Let's check out some info about history:

{:.post-content}
Simply typing `history` will show you a list of all your executed commands in linux.

{% highlight html %}
> history
1 ls
2 cd ../
3 man ls
4 clear
5 ggpush
{% endhighlight %}

{:.post-content}
A very quick tip is to use the pipe (written about [here](/social-posts/linux-sequences/))
to be able to search on what the history output shows us:

{% highlight html %}
> history | grep 'ls'
1 ls
2 man ls
{% endhighlight %}

{:.post-content}
We use <a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep" target="_blank">ripgrep</a>
which is an extremely fast and easy to use search tool so our search would be:

{% highlight html %}
> history | rg 'ls'
{% endhighlight %}

{:.post-content}
If you want to customize how your history output displays, linux gives you some
options you can specify to change the display:

{% highlight html %}
export HISTTIMEFORMAT="%F %T: "

# %F Equivalent to %Y - %m - %d
# %T Replaced by the time ( %H : %M : %S )
{% endhighlight %}

{:.post-content}
You would specify this in your .bashrc or your .bash_profile.
You can also set an option to ignore duplicate commands in your history:

{% highlight html %}
export HISTCONTROL=ignoredups
{% endhighlight %}

{:.post-content}
Set the number of commands stored in your history with the HISTSIZE variable:

{% highlight bash %}
export HISTSIZE=50000
{% endhighlight %}
