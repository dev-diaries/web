One of the things a web developer probably consistently uses every day in dev 
tools is the ability to inspect the contents of a webpage. You can inspect an 
element and view the HTML nodes, see the Javascript event listeners on an element, 
and see the CSS properties attached to an element. It is an essential tool to 
know how to use well and one that youâ€™ll use often.
