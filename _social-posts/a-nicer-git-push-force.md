Most of us have had to git push --force before to overwrite the remote history 
of your repository. That command should be used with caution and you also might 
want to consider using git push --force-with-lease instead. It will block your 
force push if the remote branch has been updated and you donâ€™t have the latest 
fetched in your repository. This might prevent you from throwing away someone elseâ€™s work without realizing it ðŸ˜³

{% highlight git %}
git push origin master --force-with-lease
