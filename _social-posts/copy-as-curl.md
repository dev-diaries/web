An extremely helpful debugging tool is to copy a network request as a cURL 
request. Right clicking on a network request will bring down the option. This is 
available in Firefox as also in the network tab as ‚Äúcopy as cURL‚Äù. Oh! Let‚Äôs not 
forget about Safari, copy as curl is also located in the network tab ü§ì.
