If you’re using an Apple computer you might want to check out one of our favorite
mac utilities, Alfred. It is like Spotlight on steroids with tons of useful
functionality built in and is incredibly customizable allowing you to program
your own workflows and shortcuts.

There are a lots of useful elements with Alfred and in this intro post we'll cover
some of the base. The first thing we can say that if you're going to use Alfred
it is absolutely worth getting the <a href="https://www.alfredapp.com/powerpack/" target="_blank">Powerpack</a>
as it unlocks the most powerful features of Alfred. This overview assumes you have
the powerpack. First, you set your hotkey for what will trigger Alfred.

The biggest benefit of Alfred is the ability to not take your hands off the keyboard and use
Alfred instead to perform a lot of the functionality that you would normally perform
with your mouse. Now using your hotkey will bring up Alfred:

## File Search

If you need to quick open or find a file, using Alfred you can customize how you
search and quickly use Alfred to find whatever you're looking for. Again, this
is similar to Apple's Spotlight, but on steroids.

## Web Search

Using Alfred you can quickly launch a web based search from the Alfred prompt
that can target specific websites.

For instance you can search specifically StackOverflow:
