Docker: the containerization you can't seem to escape. Docker can allow you great
power and flexibility to make your application light weight portable. But wait,
what exactly is docker? And how can you get
started with Docker? Let's set out to figure those things out.

## What is it?

{:.post-content}
Docker allows you to package and ship your application in a standardized
and consistent format. Get the shipping references yet? Running an application
with docker allows you to start it with a single command and that command
can be consistent for your local and production environments.


## Install

{:.post-content}
If you're on a mac you can head over to the Docker [Install Docker Desktop For Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/)
page as that is the easiest way to get Docker setup on your computer. If you've followed
the steps successfully and have it up and running, inputting:
{% highlight bash %}
docker ps
{% endhighlight %}
{:.post-content}
into your terminal should give you an output something like this:
{% highlight bash %}
CONTAINER ID      IMAGE           COMMAND       CREATED         STATUS         PORTS          NAMES
{% endhighlight %}

If you're running linux, depending on the flavor you'll have to run a few commands
to get it installed successfully. Each flavor's installation insturctions can be found on
the Docker website:

* [Debian](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/debian/)

* [Ubuntu](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/)

## Ship

Now that you have docker up and running you can download an image and get an
example application running. We're going to get an application running that
outputs "hello world", because programming üòè. Docker can run certain images,
and for our case we're going to run a `helloworld` image that can be found
[here](https://hub.docker.com/r/karthequian/helloworld). In our terminal let's run:

{% highlight bash %}
docker run -p 8080:80/tcp "karthequian/helloworld:latest"
{% endhighlight %}

{:.post-content}
Assuming you haven't run this image before, you should see some output where Docker
is telling you that it is downloading this image locally since we've never run it before:
{% highlight bash %}
docker run -p 8080:80/tcp "karthequian/helloworld:latest"
Unable to find image 'karthequian/helloworld:latest' locally

Status: Downloaded newer image for karthequian/helloworld:latest
{% endhighlight %}

Once it finishes downloading it will just hang in your terminal, which means it
downloaded successfully and is running. Let's break down the command we ran to start:

{% highlight bash %}
docker run -p 8080:80/tcp "karthequian/helloworld:latest"
{% endhighlight %}

We're telling docker to bind our machine (the docker host) at port 8080 to the docker
container at port 80 using a TCP connection. ([ü§î Read more](https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/container-networking/)).
In short, we're telling the application to run on our computer at port 8080.
Now if we go to our browser and go to the address: `http://localhost:8080` we should
see our application!
