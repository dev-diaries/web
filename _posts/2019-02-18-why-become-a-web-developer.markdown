## Constantly Learning

{:.post-content}
The world of web development moves at an insanely fast pace. So much so that much has
been written about developer fatigue:

This just goes to show that there is a bottomless amount of information to learn
about web development. On one hand this can be very overwhelming especially
if you try and learn everything all at once:

However, on the other hand, if you like constantly being challenged and have the opportunity
to learn something new almost every day then web development is the place for you.
There is however, a delicate balance between learning new things and improving
on what you know. With each new area you dive into the rabbit hole becomes that much deeper
of things and vocabulary that you need to know. So therefore, it is important
to take things slowly, but always be curious and open to explore.
## Freedom

{:.post-content}
Being a web developer opens up a world of freedom from remote work to freelancing
to working as a contractor. There are plenty of sites dedicated to finding 
remote work and also finding freelance gigs:

* [We work remotely](https://weworkremotely.com/)
* [Remote jobs](https://remote.co/remote-jobs/)
* [Remote OK](https://remoteok.io/)
A [number of companies](https://github.com/yanirs/established-remote) are remote only 
and many more are offering up the opportunity to work from home on with regularity.
As a web developer all you really need sometimes is a computer and a reliable
internet connection.

## Builders gonna build

{:.post-content}
Being a web developer means you get the opportunity to build some pretty amazing things.
If you enjoy being creative and coming up with solutions to hard problems, then
web development will be very fulfilling to you. With the pace of web development
there are often dozen of packages and utilities you can drop into your project
to help speed up development which opens you up to be more free in figuring out
the harder problems of what you want to build.

The amount of resources on the
web make it hard to encounter a problem that someone hasn't faced before and with
sites like [Stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com) you can simply post your question and get qualified help.

Become a web developer not because it is popular to do so right now, but rather
because you think you'll be challenged and stimulated. It can be a very
rewarding profession and can bring you lots of joy.
